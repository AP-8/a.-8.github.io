    I was interested to see if the global shut down due to Covid-19 impacted carbon emissions. This tracks monthly carbon emmisions from January 2019 to November 2020. Both years experienced peak levels in May, and the lowest levls in October. Interestingly 2020 had elevated levels compared to the previous year. Suggesting the shut down did not have much of an impact on reducing global carbon emissions.
